## Research questions

* How have the win percentages for Seahawks and Mariners changed over the last forty years?

* How have the win percentages for Sounders FC changed over the last ten years?

* How have the win percentages for Storm changed over the last twenty years?

## Methods

* This project was concerned with answering the question of how the win percentages of the four major Seattle sports teams (Seahawks, Mariners, Sounders FC, and Storm) have changed.
* Wikipedia was scraped for data concerning wins and losses by season for each team. 

* Data cleaning has been conducted.

* A 10-year moving average for Seahawks and Mariners was plotted to help the reader identify any major trends in the team’s win percentages. And a 3-year moving average is chosen for the two younger teams Sounders FC and Storm.
